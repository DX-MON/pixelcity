Just a few notes about this fork:

It depends a GUI framework named GTK++, which may also be found on GitHub
and soon via http://gtk.rachelmant.com/

The code is formatted to play nice with editors that don't understand
the spaces-for-tabs format. It should not matter what your tab width
is set to, I use 4 but 2 and 8 should look good too.

The Makefile has one overridable variable:
GCC - controls how GCC is configured, a typical value for this
variable for a 64-bit build is
GCC="gcc -m64 -fPIC -DPIC"

All Linux-specific stuff should be found in Linux.h
OS.h automatically switches between the Windows and Linux implementation
Under Linux, OS.h also defines the otherwise-undefined functions
GetTickCount(), GetRValue(), GetGValue() and GetBValue().
This is done this way to help minimise changes needed to be made to
the rest of the code base.

Please report bugs to dx-mon@users.sourceforge.net
