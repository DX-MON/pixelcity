Just a few notes about this fork:

It depends upon an as-yet unreleased GUI framework named GTK++,
I plan on releasing this soon but it needs a bit more work done to
make it release worthy.

The code is formatted to play nice with editors that don't understand
the spaces-for-tabs format. It should not matter what your tab width
is set to, I use 4 but 2 and 8 should look good too.

The Makefile has one overridable variable:
GCC - controls how GCC is configured, a typical value for this
variable for a 64-bit build is
GCC="gcc -m64 -fPIC -DPIC"

All Linux-specific stuff should be found in Linux.h
OS.h automatically switches between the Windows and Linux implementation
Under Linux, OS.h also defines the otherwise-undefined functions
GetTickCount(), GetRValue(), GetGValue() and GetBValue().
This is done this way to help minimise changes needed to be made to
the rest of the code base.
